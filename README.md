# Website Reputation Tester
Hello, here is my web application for bulk site reputation testing, uses third-party websites. This site doesn't test the reputation itself, but sends requests to external, specializing sites. After receiving the results, they are presented clearly in the form of a table. It's possible to check the reputation using the following pages:
 - X-Force
 - McAfee
 - VirusTotal
 - BlueCoat
 - Cisco Blacklist
 - Talos
 - IpVoid

## Requirements
You have to have Python and following packages installed by PIP:
 - **Python**
 - **Flask**
 - **BeautifulSoup**
 - **validators**.

I think application is easy to use, but if you have any question please contact me by email: **rdziwinski@gmail.com**
